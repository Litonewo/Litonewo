I am learning compsci and have experience in Java, Ruby, and C++. I am fluent in BASH and Python. I am familar with Windows and Ubuntu. 

I can speak English and traditional Chinese, though I am learning Korean.

I am currently a Life Scout (Almost Eagle!), a Cardinals baseball fan, avid programmer, backpacker, and baseball player. I also enjoy listening to kpop and country. You can usually find me playing Fallout or some other various video games with friends, or out in the backcountry backpacking.
